# Hyperskill Coffee Machine Example

What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.
#Learning outcomes

This project allows you to get a taste of Kotlin. Practice working with functions, challenge yourself with loops and conditions, and get more confident in Kotlin.
This project is a part of the following track

# What you’ll do and what you’ll learn

Write a program that puts some basic information on the screen: let the machine describe what it takes to make a cup of coffee!

Computer programming
Introduction to Kotlin
Basic literals
Overview of the basic program
Standard output
Stage implementation

Program the machine to calculate the amount of ingredients it needs depending on how many people want some coffee.
Working with conditions, program the machine to estimate how many creamy coffees it can make based on the amount of ingredients we enter.
Teach your virtual coffee machine to perform three basic actions: collect the money, renew the supplies, and serve the coffee.
Program the machine to display on the screen the amount of supplies left. Set the main loop: now the menu keeps updating until you enter “exit”.
Time for some final touch-ups: structure the code so that it runs smoothly.

# Kotlin Lang:

Kotlin is a modern programming language loved by many developers worldwide. Why Kotlin? A lot of developers are now taking to Kotlin because it is a low-maintenance, elegant, and concise language that is not prone to errors.

# While progressing through different projects of this track, you will:

* Learn Kotlin syntax and work with a variety of its features;
* Simplify your application design with functional programming;
* Understand key programming concepts such as binary numbers;
* Get familiar with helpful tools like Java and Kotlin libraries;
* Gain experience in Android development;
* Practice making your code сlear and concise even for the most complex tasks;
* Work with professional development tools, IDE;

Handle multiple tasks quickly and efficiently
